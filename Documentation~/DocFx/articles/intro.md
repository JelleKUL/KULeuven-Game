# Getting Started

## Main Goal

This Package makes it easy to create and visualize datacapture sessions.
All resources are stored as an abstract dataclass `Node()`, containing its metadata and resource (image, mesh,...).


## Data Capture

This package contains functions to capture and save Images and meshes from either in game, or real life using XR devices.


## Data Reconstruction

An big part of this package is the ability to display RDF based Sessions and Nodes.
All nodes can be visualised using the `NodeVisualizer()` 

## Extension

New nodes and Properties can be defined to suit your workflow
